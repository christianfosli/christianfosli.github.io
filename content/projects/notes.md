I'm keeping some of my personal (but non-confidential, of course ðŸ˜ƒ) notes here.
Mostly development related things, as well as "quick-ref" guides to Linux commands and similar things.

The site is generated from markdown files using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and deployed to/hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
