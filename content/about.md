I'm a senior software engineer from Stavanger, Norway.
My main areas of expertise are backend dotnet development, infrastructure-as-code,
and configuring CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure (DevOps) Pipelines.
I have several years experience building cloud-based and containerized solutions for clients,
and I have achieved several certifications related to Microsoft Azure and Kubernetes.
I like to use rust for hobby projects. I'm also a Linux enthusiast and very comfortable in the terminal.

Outside of tech I like to bicycle, work out/lift weights, and spend time with my family and friends.
I'm a husband and a dad to an amazing toddler.

On this website I will mostly post about technology, usually in English but sometimes in Norwegian.
I also highlight some of my favorite hobby projects from my GitHub.
